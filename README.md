# Ethernaut 

This repository presents solutions to the Ethernaut challenges, allowing you to practice and enhance your skills in the field of smart contract security. In each individual folder, named with the number of a specific challenge, you will find a solution that is detailed step by step in the corresponding Readme.

To complete the levels, you will need:

1. A crypto wallet. I used Metamask.
2. Testnet Ether for covering network transaction fees. I used the Goerli testnet. You can obtain test Ether from faucets, but I recommend using https://testnetbridge.com/, where you can exchange a small amount of real Ether (around 0.001) from Ethereum/Arbitrum/Optimism networks for a sufficient amount of test tokens to complete all the tasks. From the main networks, Arbitrum or Optimism are recommended due to lower fees when using testnetbridge.
3. Remix IDE. You can use the browser version with a wallet extension for completing all projects. There is no need to download the desktop version.
4. Hardhat. We will need this framework for solving certain challenges due to limitations in Remix IDE. The installation process is described in detail at https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/getting-started
